We also store a list of the age ranges for the data that we are interested in. This is because the data does include some rows that we do not want to include because they are too small, such as births from mothers under 15 years old or over 45. In testing, these only cluttered the eventual plot, so we leave them out for now."

Since we generated a list of years earlier, we use that as our x value. For y, we store a list of the number of births for every year. Since they are ordered in ascending order by year, we don't need to sort them before converting it directly to a list. From here, we can change some characteristics of our eventual graph, such as the outline color.\n",
